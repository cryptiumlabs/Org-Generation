* Org-Generation
This project gives an informal way of documenting a code-base with
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org]].

Currently this project is in alpha, and many important features are
being setup. Read [[https://github.com/cryptiumlabs/Org-Generation/issues][The issues for some features that are currently
missing]]

Some examples of this tool in action can be see in [[https://github.com/cryptiumlabs/Org-Generation/blob/master/doc/org-generation.org][this repos doc
folder]] also with [[https://github.com/cryptiumlabs/juvix/blob/develop/doc/Code/Juvix.org][Juvix's code documentation folder]].
** Currently Supported Language
- Lisp
  + With ASDF files only!
- Haskell
  + Does not currently support ={- -}= semantics, first line must be a
    =-- |=
** Installation
*** Roswell
- =ros install cryptiumlabs/org-generation=

Currently the ros file does not correctly launch the program, but it
will install the library properly.
*** Quicklisp
Another way of installing this project is by loading the asd file in
this repo, and having [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]] installed
